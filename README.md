# odin-landing-page

After completing the task of creating a landing page with HTML and CSS,
I expect to have developed my skills in web development and design principles. 
It will be a valuable learning experience for me as a beginner in website creation. 
I will need to research and learn the basics of HTML and CSS and focus on designing
an attractive and functional landing page. 
It will help me gain confidence and knowledge in this field.
